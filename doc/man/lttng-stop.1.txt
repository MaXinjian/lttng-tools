NAME
----
lttng-stop - Stop one or more LTTng recording sessions


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *stop* [option:--no-wait]
      [option:--all | option:--glob='PATTERN' | 'SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng stop` command stops one or more recording sessions, that is,
it deactivates the LTTng tracers for:

With the 'SESSION' argument::
    The recording session named 'SESSION'.

With the option:--glob='PATTERN' option::
    The recording sessions of which the globbing pattern
    'PATTERN' matches the name.

With the option:--all option::
    *All* the recording sessions of the connected session daemon for
    your Unix user, or for all users if your Unix user is `root`, as
    listed in the output of `lttng list` (see man:lttng-list(1)).
+
See the ``Session daemon connection'' section of man:lttng(1) to learn
how a user application connects to a session daemon.

Otherwise::
    The current recording session.
+
See man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more about
the current recording session.

See man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more about recording sessions.

The selected recording session(s) must be active (started; see
man:lttng-start(1)). A recording session is inactive on creation (see
man:lttng-create(1)).

A `stop-session` trigger action can also stop a recording session (see
man:lttng-add-trigger(1)).

Start one or more inactive recording sessions with the
man:lttng-start(1) command.

By default, the `stop` command ensures that the trace data of the
selected recording session(s) is valid before it exits. Make the command
exit immediately with the option:--no-wait option. In this case,
however, the traces(s) might not be valid when the command exits, and
there's no way to know when it/they becomes valid.

For each recording session to stop:

* If LTTng archived the current trace chunk (see man:lttng-rotate(1) and
  man:lttng-enable-rotation(1)) of the recording session at
  least once during its lifetime, the `stop` command renames the current
  trace chunk subdirectory and prints the renamed path. Although it's
  safe to read the content of this renamed subdirectory while the
  recording session remains inactive, it's :not: a trace chunk archive:
  you need to destroy the recording session with man:lttng-destroy(1) or
  perform a rotation with man:lttng-rotate(1) to archive it.

See the ``<<examples,EXAMPLES>>'' section below for usage examples.

option:-a, option:--all::
    Stop all the recording sessions of your Unix user, or of all
    users if your Unix user is `root`, as listed in the output of
    man:lttng-list(1).

option:-g 'PATTERN', option:--glob='PATTERN'::
    Stop the recording sessions of which the
    globbing pattern 'PATTERN' matches the name.
+
In 'PATTERN', the `*` character means ``match anything''. To match
a literal `*` character, use :escwc:.

option:-n, option:--no-wait::
    Do :not: ensure that the trace data of the selected recording
    session(s) is valid before exiting.
